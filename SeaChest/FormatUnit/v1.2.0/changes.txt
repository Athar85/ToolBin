v0.0.1  23-May-2017  1_14_3 libraries.  SeaChest_FormatUnit initial beta
                     test release.  Branched from SeaChest_Erase v1.4.0.
v0.0.2  14-Jun-2017  1_15_0 libraries adds bug fix malformed command line
                     should exit with code = 1; added detection of parallel ATA
                     and SCSI speeds; temperature data on ATA now uses the
                     values from the SCT status log or device statistics log.
                     Adds the child drive matching options --childModelMatch,
                     --childOnlyFW, and --childNewFW.
v1.0.0  14-Jul-2017  1_16_1 libraries adds support for ATA drives that have the
                     Sense Data Reporting feature enabled, changes to how we
                     interpret the completion status from the drive, new Sense
                     Data ASC, ASCQ definitions from SPC5. Adds --Scan (or -S,
                     note the capital S) aggressive system scan.
v1.0.0  27-Jul-2017  1_16_2 libraries enhances Seagate brand detection.
v1.0.0  19-Sep-2017  1_16_4 libraries fixes SCSI "--progress format", added
                     reading remanufacture time for SAS when the drive reports
                     a time, fixed SAS --abortDST.
v1.0.0  25-Sep-2017  1_17_0 libraries adds improved SATA device discovery on
                     SAS adapters, added NVMe read, write & Flush commands.
v1.1.0  10-Oct-2017  1_17_1 libraries adds Better handling of NVMe as a SCSI
                     device, SAT library strings, and fixes to Read-Buffer
                     error history (ISL). Updated copyright notice, invalid
                     command line options now only display an error instead of
                     long help. Added --setSectorSize moved from
                     SeaChest_Configure. Name change from SeaChest_FormatUnit
                     to SeaChest_Format.
v1.1.1  12-Oct-2017  1_17_3 libraries improves Fast-Format compatibility on SAS.
v1.2.0  26-Oct-2017  1_17_5 libraries fixes SATA drive discovery behind HBAs
                     that don't show as SATA and don't support the SAT VPD
                     page; added Automatic fallback to 12byte CDBs during
                     initial device discovery;  integrated fixes for SAS
                     firmware download and fixes for SAS LongDST time
                     calculation; added detection of TCG Pyrite and Opalite
                     drives. Removed --defaultFormat since that is now the
                     default behavior until other flags are added.
v1.2.0  31-Oct-2017  1_17_6 libraries adds ATA Security compatibility with SATL
                     on some LSI adapters, corrects firmware download issue
                     under Windows 10 API.
v1.2.0  02-Nov-2017  1_17_7 libraries fixes Long DST time on SCSI/SAS products.
